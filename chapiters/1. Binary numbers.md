Respentation of data the reason why I want to do this is because I want to give everyone a base level understanding of the concepts of these low-level data storage formats like binaty so you better understand how data is being used and manipulated at the very lowest level.

This is going to help a lot with understanding the different concepts related to assembly ang working at a low level of programming and it just like helps you with generally working around with data because it's going to make it so you aren't fighting with the binary anymore you can just innately inderstand the way that it's working ang ne able to understand how to convert between the different formats it will just make things a lot easier working at a low level.

So, let's jump right into things and let's talk a little bit about base numbering systems 

So there are a few different bases that we can use for our numbering systems and the ont that I want to talk about first is base 10.

Base 10 number systems are the ones that you are most familiar with and you use them every single day whether you know it's base 10 or not it's the one that you are always using

So the way that base 10 works is that we allow for digits 0 to 9 to be used so this is 10 different digits that you can possibly use.

and basically what hapjpens is we can construct numbers by combinimg these digits together 

so for instance the number 13 is the comvination of two digits: digit 1 and digit 3. And when you look at this you instaictively understand that is 13. Just because that's something that you've always been taught right you've always used this numbering system so it's realy automatic to say yup that's 13 and that's the valer of it but maybe you haven't ever stopped and asked well why is this actually equal to 13. why does this representation actually work ant reason that it is equal to 13 is because each of these different slots actually represents a different power of 10.

So what happens is this first slot here represents the smallest possible power of 10 to the power of 0. The second slot represent the second highest so it'd be 10 to the power of 1. And this sequence continers as you continue on through the numbers you could have 10 cubed and that just continues on forever as large as the number ends up getting if you remember some of your maybe early education you would recall that a lot of the time would refer to this as like the ones the would be referred to as like the tens and then we have like the hunbreds and the thousands and then the tens of thousands and so on and so forth like this.

So what's happening here is besically each of these digits represents one of these powers and what we can do is we can take this digit and multiply it by its respective power and then add it to thas digit multiplied by this power and that will give us the actual value back so what I mean by that is if you take 1 and you multiply it by 10 to the power of 1 and add that to 3 multiplied by 10 to the power of 0. 

What you get is you get 1 times 10 plus 3 times 1 because 10 to the power of 0 is equal to 1.

This gives us 10 plus 3 which is equal to 13. So this is the way that our base 10 numbering system works is that each of these digit represents a power of 10 and then we can multiply and add them together to get the actual value that's being represented so that's the very simple straighforward idea of the base 10 numbering system and the reason why i show you this is because it's going to make it easeir to intuitively understand the way that binary works as binary is a base two numbering system which will use a lot of the same principles just with less values.

So let's go into that we'll just remember this base 10 idea and let's jump right into binary and with binary what we have is rather than having the values zero to to nine we have two possible values the value zero and the value 1 those are the only 2 values that exist and we can once again combine them together in order ato different values so for instance i have this value 1 0 1 0 and we have the same sort of idea this first digit represents the smallest power of 2 in this case because it's base 2 rather than base 10. This next one represents 2 to the power of 1. This one represents 2 squared this one represents 2 cubed then we apply the same process we have 1 times 2 to the power of 3 right I'm taking this digit multiplying it by this power. I add that to zero times two squared plus one times plus one times two to the power of one right I'm just continuing down the line multiplying each of these digits by their powers and then we have that as zero times two to the power of zero.

What that gives us is it gives us one times eight plus zweo plus one times two plus zero eight plus two equals ten so that fives us the value ten and as you can see i've just translated this binary number into our base 10 decimal value so you can see that this is equal to 10.

So that shows you how you can convert from binary to decimal and it dives you a bit more intuition around how we're representing values in a binary now one thing that you might be thinking is well why do we even need binary to begin with and the reason for this is because when you work at a very low level you're starting to work with the actual way that the circuits are interacting with the hardware this means that rather than looking at digits we're looking at elecrtical circuits those elecrtical circuits can be powered on or oiwered off they have two different states that exist and because of this we can actually represent then very easily in vinaty we say one is equal to on and zero is equal to off and that allows us to represent things using elecrtical signals right so what that means is basically that rather than interacting with things like digits we're interacting with electrical signals because we're working at a very low level with the cpu and hardware so eather than thinking in decimals we now think in binary so you could think that each of these represents like a wire.

This wire is on this one's off this one's in this one's off and that comnination creates the value 10. 

So that's how things are working at a very very low level 
Now although you're not necessarily going to work with a binary directly a lot of the time it still helps to inderstand exactly how binary works because ti makes the higher level interpretations easier to inderstand when we talk about things like hexadecimal it's going to build off of this binary idea so we want to understand the binary first so this should have you a better understanding of how binaty is being built and how we can represent the um the deciamal values using binary right so the last thing that i want to show you here is I just want to show you how we can actually convert a value into binary from decimal so we went from binary to decimal now we're hoing to go from decimal to binary right so the things that I want to whow you here is I just want to show you how we can actually convert a value into binary from decimal so we went from binary to decimal now we're going to go from decimal to binary
So let me show you what that looks like suppose that we want to take the value 37 and I want to convert it into binary what i'm going to do is i'm hoing to create this little table. Here and I'm going to have three columns the first is called division I'm going to call this one the results I'm hoing to call this one the remainder 

 div  | res | remainder
------------------------
 37/2 |  18 | 1
 18/2 |  9  | 0     
  9/2 |  4  | 1 
  4/2 |  2  | 0
  2/2 |  1  | 0   
  1/2 |  0  | 1

What we're hoing to do is we're going to take 37 and we're going to write the integer result of that division here which would be 16.
16 times 2 would be 36 and there would be a remainder of 1.
We're then hoing to take this 16 and we're gonna divide it by two would give us eight with a remainder of zero or teah it would give us eight exactly and then we're going to continue along this process until we essentially end up with u getting back down to one that's where we're hoing to end our process (I just realized this actually wouldn't be 16 it would be 18 right, because 18 times 2 would be 6 carry the 1 would be 36.
So we have 18 divided by 2 which would be 9 with a remainder of 0.
Next we world have 9 divided by 2 which would be 4 with a remainder of 1.
We have 4 divided by 2 which would be 2 with remainder of 0
We have 2 divided by 2 which would be 1 or yeah which would be 1 with remainder of 0. 
Now we have 1 devided by 2 which would be 0 with a remainder of 1.
Now these remainds here can be used to construct the binary number and the way that works is we read from bottom to top and we write them out so we say 100101
You see I've just taken each of these digits individually and just written them from left instead of bottom to up this is the resulting binary number and I could prove that that's the case because this is 2 th the power of 0 this is 2 to the power of 2 and this is 2 of the power of 5. 2 to the power of 5 is 32 this is 4 and then this is 1 that gives me the value 37.
Soyou can see how we did that conversation and how it actually does result in the propre value so now you should understand the idea of going from decimal to binary and going from binary to decimal this will be helpful because if you ever heve values that are stored in binary you should now be able to relatively intuitively convert them back to decimal they give you a better intuition about the representations of these values 
so hopefully this makes things a bit more clear about how binary generally works.
